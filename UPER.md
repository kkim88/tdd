<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* Must create a tax program from scratch
* Must apply a flat tax to items
* Must sort items into categories
* Must have exemptions for certain items
* Must have additional tax for imported items
* Must incorporate rounding
* Needs to print a receipt
* Uses the provided test cases
* Needs to use aspects of code quality
<h2>2. Planning the Solution</h2>
* Seems like a simple program at first, but is actually complex
* Look to other sales/retail programs
* Break the program down into parts: items, tax, receipt, order(?)
* Plan structure
* Start with resources provided, then find others
* Must learn how to get the program to accept test cases
*
*
*
<h2>3. Executing the Plan</h2>
* Begin with the easiest parts to get them out of the way
* Get the gitignore done first
* Tests can be put into separate files
* Learn proper formulas for the tax logic
* Code tax project
* Code items
* Code receipt
*
